As it is, the timeout system is not at all optimal. There is potential for an
attacker to keep a port open when a connection has timed out by continuously
sending packets from a bad TID. According to the RFC, this does not cause the
server child to close the connection. The timeout does not increment in this
case and has the potential for an attacker to send a packet a second and
potentially crash the server by allowing keeping too many open ports.
