As it is, the timeout system is not at all optimal. There is potential for an
attacker to keep a port open when a connection has timed out by continuously
sending packets from a bad TID. According to the RFC, this does not cause the
server child to close the connection. The timeout does not increment in this
case and has the potential for an attacker to send a packet a second and
potentially crash the server by allowing keeping too many open ports.

There is potential (though highly unlikely chance) for tftp_recvfrom to have
issues. If a packet from a bad TID and a packet from the correct source arrive
at the same time, recvfrom may return the contents of both packets in the
buffer. This is however, highly unlikely to happen and as such is considered not
to be a concern.

During a WRQ, if the file is already present no error is thrown. Instead it is
truncated 0 length and overwritten.

File access permission errors and other file access errors are not fully
implemented.
